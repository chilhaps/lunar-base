# Lunar Base

A browser-based management interface for someone who lives on the moon and manages The Cage. Sits alongside **lunar-tear** and lets you back up, restore, and edit the player database from a browser.

> Web-based control panel for a [Lunar Tear](https://github.com/Walter-Sparrow/lunar-tear) private server.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.10 or newer (tested on 3.14)
- Go 1.25 or newer on `PATH` *(needed to build the `lunar-base-grant` shim; without it stages 1+ won't work)*
- A working [Lunar Tear](https://github.com/Walter-Sparrow/lunar-tear) checkout at the sibling path `..\lunar-tear\`
- The [lunar-scripts](https://gitlab.com/walter-sparrow-group/lunar-scripts) repo at `..\lunar-scripts\` *(only needed for the one-time master-data dump in stage 2+)*
- The encrypted master data binary at `..\lunar-tear\server\assets\release\20240404193219.bin.e` *(populated by the lunar-tear setup, not by us)*

### Expected directory layout

## Setup & Running

### Setup (run once)

Windows:

```bat
setup.bat
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This creates a virtual environment in `.venv/` and installs Python dependencies from `web/requirements.txt`. Re-run any time dependencies change or after pulling new shim sources.

### Run

Windows:

```bat
run-lunar-base.bat
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
./run-lunar-base.sh
```

Both scripts accept optional flags:

```bash
./run-lunar-base.sh --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9088
```

```bat
run-lunar-base.bat --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9088
```

The default is `127.0.0.1:8888` when no flags are provided. Then open **http://127.0.0.1:8888** in your browser. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server.

## Master Data & English Names

Stages 1+ (currency / costume / weapon / upgrade / memoir editors) require two things derived from the game's data files:

- **Master data tables** decoded from the encrypted `.bin.e` to JSON.
- **English display names** extracted from lunar-tear's text-bundle revisions.

`setup.bat` handles both automatically on first run. Subsequent runs detect existing output and skip.

| Step | Output directory | Source |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Master-data dump | `data\masterdata\` | `..\lunar-tear\server\assets\release\*.bin.e` |
| Names extraction | `data\names\` | `data\masterdata\` + `..\lunar-tear\server\assets\revisions\` |

Both output directories are gitignored and together hold ~700 JSON files.

> If the game's data ever changes (a server-side patch), redump by deleting `data\masterdata\` and `data\names\`, then re-running `setup.bat`.

### Manual fallback

If the master-data dump is skipped (lunar-scripts or `.bin.e` missing) or fails, run it yourself:

```bat
cd ..\lunar-scripts
py dump_masterdata.py --input ..\lunar-tear\server\assets\release\20240404193219.bin.e --output ..\lunar-base\data\masterdata
```

The dump needs `pycryptodome msgpack lz4`. `setup.bat` installs these into `.venv\` automatically; for a fully manual run, install them globally:

```bat
pip install pycryptodome msgpack lz4
```

If the names extraction is skipped or fails, run it from the `lunar-base` root:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\extract_names.py
```

Defaults read from `data\masterdata\` and `..\lunar-tear\server\assets\revisions\`, writing to `data\names\`. Run with `--help` to override any of those paths.

## Stages

| # | Name | Status | Description |
|---|------|--------|-------------|
| 0a | Backup & Restore |  Done | Snapshot `game.db`, restore from snapshots. Restore refuses while lunar-tear is running. Rolling pool keeps the 50 most recent snapshots. |
| 0b | Read-only Viewer |  Done | Pick a player, see currencies and inventory counts. |
| 1 | Item Editor |  Done | Top up gems, gold, materials, consumables, and important items. All grants are additive and routed through lunar-tear's `GrantPossession`. Per-tab **GRANT ALL CHOSEN** batches every row with an amount set; **MAX ALL** on Consumables/Materials runs a curated rule set in a single transaction. |
| 2 | Costume Editor |  Done | Grant 4-star (R40) and 3-star (R30) playable costumes via `GrantCostume`. R20 story-starter costumes are excluded. Sort order: Recollections of Dusk (Frozen-Heart / F-H) » Dark Memory » Other 4-Star » 3-Star, alphabetical within each group. |
| 3 | Weapon Editor |  Done | Grant playable weapons via `GrantWeapon`, cascading into skills, abilities, weapon notes, and story unlocks. R20 chains excluded. 519-entry catalog split into RoD » Dark Memory » Other 4-Star » 3-Star. RoD and Dark Memory grant the final R50 form; others grant the base step for in-game evolution. Hard 999-row inventory cap enforced; oversized batches refused with a clear error. Already-owned weapons filtered client-side. **After mass-adding DM weapons, run "Skip All DM Cutscenes" from the Upgrade Manager** — the game queues a forced cutscene per DM acquisition and only plays one per launch, which soft-locks progression until the queue drains. |
| 4 | Upgrade Manager |  Done | Three sections, ten actions: **Characters** (Exalt All Available, Fill Mythic Slab Pages); **Inventory** (Add All Missing Companions / Remnants / Debris); **Mass Upgrades** (Upgrade All Companions to lv50, Upgrade All Weapons cost-bypassing the full evolve/ascend/refine/enhance/skill path, Upgrade All Costumes cost-bypassing awaken/ascend/enhance/active-skill plus 3 unlocked karma slots, Skip All DM Cutscenes to clear the queued DM-acquisition cutscene loop, Fill All Karma Slots with rarest-or-chosen effect per slot). |
| 5 | Memoir Editor |  Done | R40 memoir grants and edits. **Build a Set** grants the 3 memoirs of any of the 18 sets at lv15 with caller-chosen primary main-stat (one of 6 percent/Agility tier-4 options) and 4 sub-stat slots (perfect-roll defaults editable). **Upgrade All Memoirs** sweeps every owned memoir to lv15. **Fix Slots** rewrites the 4 sub-status rows on a single memoir. 999-memoir inventory cap pre-flighted. |

## Architecture

```
lunar-base\
├── web\          Python (FastAPI + Jinja2) — UI and orchestration
├── tools\        Supporting scripts and the Go shim
│   ├── extract_names.py       Resolves entity IDs to English names from lunar-tear's text bundles
│   └── grant\
│       ├── src\               Go source for the lunar-base-grant shim
│       └── grant.exe          Compiled binary (built by setup.bat, gitignored)
└── data\         Gitignored — master-data JSON, name maps, and DB backups
```

- **`web\`** reads `game.db` directly via the `sqlite3` standard library; all mutations shell out to the Go shim.
- **`tools\grant\grant.exe`** reads one JSON request from stdin and writes one JSON response to stdout. Implemented actions: `grant_possession`, `grant_batch`, `grant_costume_batch`, `grant_weapon_batch`, `grant_companion_batch`, `grant_thought_batch`, `exalt_characters`, `release_panels`, `upgrade_all_companions`, `upgrade_all_weapons`, `upgrade_all_costumes`, `fill_karma_slots`, `set_costume_karma_batch`, `grant_memoir_batch`, `upgrade_all_memoirs`, `set_memoir_subs_batch`, `mark_contents_stories_played`.
- **`tools\extract_names.py`** is adapted from Engels (used with permission).

### How the Go shim is built

Lunar Base never modifies lunar-tear's source tree, but the shim must import lunar-tear's internal grant code. Go's `internal/` package rule requires the importing code to live inside `lunar-tear/server/`, so `setup.bat` does the following each run:

1. Copies `tools\grant\src\*.go` into `..\lunar-tear\server\cmd\lunar-base-grant\` (creating it if needed). The `lunar-base-grant` name is distinct from lunar-tear's own commands so its origin is obvious.
2. Runs `go build` against that directory and writes `grant.exe` back to `tools\grant\grant.exe` inside lunar-base.

The `lunar-base-grant\` directory will appear under `lunar-tear\server\cmd\` after running `setup.bat` — this is expected. Lunar Base does not edit, delete, or version-control anything else in lunar-tear's tree.

> If `go` is not on your PATH, the build is skipped with a warning and stages 1+ will not work. Install Go 1.25+ and re-run `setup.bat`.

---

## Safety

- Lunar Base **only writes** to `..\lunar-tear\server\db\game.db` and `..\lunar-tear\server\cmd\lunar-base-grant\`. No other files in `lunar-tear\` or `lunar-scripts\` are touched.
- Every mutation takes an **automatic backup** beforehand, filed under `data\backups\` with a reason tag (`item-editor`, `costume-editor`, `weapon-editor`, `upgrade-manager`, `memoir-editor`, `pre-restore`, or `manual`). Backups are pruned to the 50 most recent of any kind.
- **Restore refuses** if it detects lunar-tear is running, preventing active database corruption.
- All grants are **additive** — Lunar Base never decreases quantities. Roll back via backup if needed.
